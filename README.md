# Dataproject JavaScript

Data project with the graphs generated on the browser using HighCharts.

## How to run ?
You can clone this repo and run the following code:
```bash

```
It starts a localhost server.
Head to that url and open `project.html` file to see the graphs.

The link for csv file used can be found at the subtitle of each graph OR you can download it from <a href="https://datahub.io/core/population-growth-estimates-and-projections/r/population-estimates.csv">here</a>.

JSON files are located in `datasets/json` for each graph.
